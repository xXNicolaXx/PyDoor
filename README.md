# PyDoor
A python backdoor that allows to use a Windows CMD and permits to download and upload files

To start the server type on a shell: python3 server.py

You can test the program starting the client first and then the server or vice versa.

This version works only on linux due to fact that Windows doesn't allow colored characters in terminal.  

If you want to use that on Windows, remove the color in the interface.py code
